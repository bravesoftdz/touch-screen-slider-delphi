Slider Control for Touch-Screen Applications

At Oasis Digital we are working on an application that will run on a touch-screen computer, and which will be used to (among other things) control an audio amplification system. There are some design considerations for touch-screen applications which are rather stark once you use the touch-screen for a few minutes. More details are available online:

This code compiles with Delphi 2007, and should work with older and newer versions with little effort.
